Compound Neuron library

neuron classes in this library are designed to be assembled into one compound
C type structure to be integrated simultaneously (as they should be) instead
of implicit decoupling by seperate integration function calls in the older
neurlib. 

The version 2 uses STL type lists and vectors instead of home-made versions.
